This is a repository containing my attempts (Whether completed/correct or not) and solutions to the challenges from r/dailyprogrammer

Most of the solutions here will be written in Python 3.x or higher, however, future solutions may be done in other languages

Challenges solved and extra comments:

#1-easy : As it says, its easy and fairly simple.

#1-intermediate : Took a long while to do since I used it to also learn using Json files.
                Also my solution is written fairly bad.

#1-hard : Easier and far less time consuming than the intermediate question.
        Could probably be really shortened, however the code works, so this should be fine for now.


#2-easy : Not too difficult, as expected, nothing else needs to be said.

(uncompleted/skipped) #2-intermediate
